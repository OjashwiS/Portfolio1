									<h2><a href="#">About Me<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>I am a human services professional with a Master of Arts in Global Development and Peace with concentration in conflict analysis. I have worked in the sector of youth empowerment for 5+ years with focus on public safety, persons with disability, and education. I have finessed interpersonal communication, community outreach, team leadership, program management and critical analysis over the years. I strongly believe and advocate ‘right to education for all’, ‘mental health matters’, ‘inclusion of people with disability and LGBTQ+’ in all sectors.<br />
									<br> <br> Here are some projects and my work experiences that are milestones in my professional journey.

									<h2><a href="#">Role of water stress/scarcity in the empowerment of violence during internal conflicts<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>The thesis is an in-depth investigation and analysis on the relationship between conflict and water crisis.<br />
									Water is the ‘petroleum’ of the new era. It is getting scarce everyday with growing population, and the growing demand for it is creating a conflict-zone within and among states. The question lies whether water stress has the potential to spark war, and if water sources have a role to play in escalating and settling conflicts. 
									The fragile states of the world have a hard time achieving development goals and access to clean drinking water while the non-fragile states have made their way to development. Water scarcity is also mostly seen in war prone, and war affected areas. It is likely that water has a significant role to play in making or breaking of a state. This paper investigates on those aspects of water stress that will clarify the role of water in conflict management.
